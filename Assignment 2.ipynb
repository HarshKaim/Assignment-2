    "\n",
    "1. Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.py` extension. For example, you can use a command like `nano script.py` to create and open the file using the nano text editor.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Save the file and exit the text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python script is located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if the script is in the \"Documents\" directory, you can use `cd Documents` to navigate to that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the Python script using the `python` command followed by the script's filename. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Press Enter to run the command. The Python interpreter will execute the code in the script, and you should see the output in the terminal:\n"
